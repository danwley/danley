I'm a recent graduate of the Cambridge MEng, currently working as a research assistant under the direction of my supervisors [Dr Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and [Umang Bhatt](https://umangsbhatt.github.io/). My research has been centered around providing meaningful explanations for uncertainty estimates within deep learning, as part of the broader field of explainable AI.

Outside of work I'm a regular footballer for the university and enjoy long distance running or working out as part of my week.
