I work with [Julius Adebayo](https://juliusadebayo.com/) at [Guide Labs](https://www.guidelabs.ai/) redesigning LLMs to learn to output which training data they are using every time they make a prediction ([blog](https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/prism/)).

I'm also a PhD student at Harvard, supervised by [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). We recently worked on [efficient data attribution techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09940) and [faithful reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10625). I previously worked within JPMorgan AI Research under the direction of [Daniele Magazzeni](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/daniele.magazzeni/) and [Saumitra Mishra](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=On6E6ogAAAAJ&hl=en), where I researched new [global counterfactual explanation methods](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ley23a.html). Before that, I graduated the Cambridge MEng, where I was supervised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and [Umang Bhatt](https://umangsbhatt.github.io/). My research centered around providing meaningful [explanations for uncertainty estimates](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20702) from probabilistic models.

Outside of work I've been a regular footballer, played for the University of Cambridge Blues, coached the Corpus Christi College team, and currently compete for MIT FC in the BSSL.
