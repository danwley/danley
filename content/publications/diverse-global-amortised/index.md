abstract: To interpret uncertainty estimates, we extend recent work that generates multiple Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty Explanations (ùõø-CLUEs), by applying additional constraints for diversity in the optimisation objective (‚àá-CLUE). We then propose a distinct method for discovering GLobal AMortised CLUEs (GLAM-CLUE) which learns mappings of arbitrary complexity between groups of uncertain and certain groups in a computationally efficient manner.

Appeared as a conference paper at AAAI 2022.
